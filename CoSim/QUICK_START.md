- Files go to `/uploaded/` folder automatically
- Directory structure is preserved
- All files get syntax highlighting

### Keyboard Power User
- `Ctrl+P` - Quick file open
- `Ctrl+F` - Find in file
- `Alt+Click` - Multi-cursor
- `Ctrl+D` - Select next occurrence

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Autocomplete Not Showing
1. Press `Ctrl+Space` to force trigger
2. Make sure you're in a `.py` or `.cpp` file
3. Type more characters (e.g., `pri` instead of just `p`)

### Upload Button Missing
1. Check the Explorer panel (left sidebar)
2. Look for "Explorer" header at the top
3. Buttons should be on the right: "📤 Files" and "📁 Folder"
4. If missing, refresh the page

### Files Not Uploading
1. Check file size (very large files may be slow)
2. Only text files supported (no binaries)
3. Look in `/uploaded/` folder in file tree
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)
